### Other Interests

* Podcasts - I'm a massive fan of comedy and movies. Joe Rogans podcast is incredbile. I'm quite fond of Review Avenues weekly Film and TV show podcast too. You can see their show on [SPOTIFY HERE](https://open.spotify.com/show/4aeIPLI2P3aN5GHV6QMJfx?si=bv3NAny9TpGsOgpetbMGLw)
* Hiking - As I used to live in the lake district I gained a real taste for adventure, hiking up a fell or around a lake every weekend in the lake district is a perfect weekend out for me.
* Music Production - Mixing and mastering. So if you have a song or album to record and release then I'm your guy.
* Drum Lessons - I do offer drum lessons, from begineers to intermediate levels. I have 15 years experience and I am self taught.
* Gaming - Whether it's on my PC, PS4, Xbox or Raspberry Pi, I love to game. Halo 3 or Fifa any time of the day. :)
