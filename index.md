### Other Interests

* Hiking - As I used to live in the lake district I gained a real taste for adventure, hiking up a fell or around a lake every weekend in the lake district is a perfect weekend out for me.
* Music Production - Mixing and mastering. So if you have a song or album to record and release then I'm your guy.
